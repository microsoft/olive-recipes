# Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct Model Optimization

This repository demonstrates the optimization of the [Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct) model using **post-training quantization (PTQ)** techniques. The optimization process is divided into three main workflows:

- QDQ for AMD NPU
- PTQ + AOT for QNN NPU
   + This process extends the QDQ flow and compiling specifically for **Qualcomm NPUs**
- OpenVINO for Intel NPU
   + This process uses OpenVINO specific passes like `OpenVINOOptimumConversion`, `OpenVINOIoUpdate` and `OpenVINOEncapsulation`

## **QDQ Model with 4-bit Weights & 16-bit Activations**

This workflow produces an ONNX QDQ model that is agnostic to the target hardware and accelerator, making it suitable for general inference.

### **Optimization Process**

The model is optimized using **weight-only quantization** and **activation quantization** for efficient deployment. The process includes:

1. **Weight Rotation ([QuaRot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00456))**
   - Reduces outliers from weights and hidden states to enhance quantization efficiency.

2. **4-bit Per-Channel Symmetric Quantization ([GPTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323))**
   - Reduces transformer layer size while preserving accuracy.

3. **ONNX Graph Capture**
   - Exports the model to ONNX for further optimization.

4. **4-bit Block-wise Quantization**
   - Applies weight-only quantization to the **embedding layer** and **language modeling head**.

5. **16-bit Activation Quantization**
   - Uses 16-bit activations to balance precision and efficiency.

The final output is a **QDQ model** with **4-bit weights** and **16-bit activations**. This model also leverages [GroupQueryAttention (GQA)](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/main/docs/ContribOperators.md#com.microsoft.GroupQueryAttention) for efficient long-context processing and long-sequence generation.

### **Handling Dynamic and Static Input Shapes**

NPUs require **precompiled graphs**, meaning the model must use **static input shapes**. However, **text generation** involves two distinct processing stages:

- **Prefill (Prompt Processing)**: Processes multiple tokens simultaneously.
- **Token Generation (Iteration)**: Processes one token at a time.

To support both efficiently, we create **two model instances**:
1. **Prefill model**: Optimized for batch processing.
2. **Token generation model**: Optimized for one-token-at-a-time inference.

## **PTQ + AOT Compilation for Qualcomm NPUs using QNN EP**

This process extends the [**QDQ Model with 4-bit Weights & 16-bit Activations**](#qdq-model-with-4-bit-weights--16-bit-activations) by compiling it specifically for **Qualcomm NPUs** using the **QNN Execution Provider**.

### **Resource Optimization Strategy**

To maximize efficiency while supporting dynamic input handling:

- **Embedding Layer & Language Model Head** → Executed on CPU (handles dynamic input).
- **Transformer Layers** → Executed on NPU (requires static input shapes).
- **Weight Sharing** → Prefill & token generation models reuse weights to minimize memory usage.

> ⚠️ **Note:** GQA is an ONNX Runtime *contrib operator* and must be executed on the CPU. The model graph is partitioned into **CPU (GQA nodes)** and **NPU (other nodes)** for execution.

### **Compilation for Qualcomm NPU Deployment**

Once optimized, the model is compiled for Qualcomm NPUs using **ONNX Runtime QNNExecutionProvider**. The steps include:

1. **Split the Quantized Model** → Divide into three parts:
   - **Embedding Layer**
   - **Transformer Layers**
   - **Language Model Head**
2. **Set Static Input Shapes**:
   - **(1, 64)** for prefill (batch size, sequence length).
   - **(1, 1)** for token generation.
3. **Compile using QNNExecutionProvider**:
   - Leverages **weight sharing** across the prefill and token generation models.

### **Usage**

This workflow is configured using the `qnn_config.json` file. It contains all of the quantization and compilation steps. It requires two separate Python environments described below.

#### A workable version

- python=3.10
- CUDA=12.1
- cudnn=9.2.0

#### Quantization Python Environment Setup

Quantization is resource-intensive and requires GPU acceleration. In an [x64 Python environment with Olive installed](https://github.com/microsoft/Olive/blob/main/examples/README.md#important), install the required packages:

```bash
# Install common dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install ONNX Runtime GPU packages
pip install "onnxruntime-gpu>=1.21.0" "onnxruntime-genai-cuda>=0.6.0"

# AutoGPTQ: Install from source (stable package may be slow for weight packing)
# Disable CUDA extension build (not required)
# Linux
export BUILD_CUDA_EXT=0
# Windows
# set BUILD_CUDA_EXT=0

# Install AutoGPTQ from source
pip install --no-build-isolation git+https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ.git
```

> ⚠️ Only set up the environment and install the packages. Do not run the `olive run` command at this point.

#### AOT Compilation Python Environment Setup

Model compilation using QNN Execution Provider requires a Python environment with onnxruntime-qnn installed. In a separate Python environment with Olive installed, install the required packages:

```bash
# Install ONNX Runtime QNN
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/refs/heads/main/requirements.txt
pip install -U --pre --extra-index-url https://aiinfra.pkgs.visualstudio.com/PublicPackages/_packaging/ORT-Nightly/pypi/simple onnxruntime-qnn --no-deps
```

Replace `/path/to/qnn/env/bin` in `qnn_config.json` with the path to the directory containing your QNN environment's Python executable. This path can be found by running the following command in the environment:

```bash
# Linux
command -v python
# Windows
# where python
```

This command will return the path to the Python executable. Set the parent directory of the executable as the `/path/to/qnn/env/bin` in the config file.

#### **Run the Quantization + Compilation Config**

Activate the **Quantization Python Environment** and run the workflow:

```bash
olive run --config qnn_config.json
```

Olive will run the AOT compilation step in the **AOT Compilation Python Environment** specified in the config file using a subprocess. All other steps will run in the **Quantization Python Environment** natively.

✅ Optimized model saved in: `./model`

> ⚠️ If optimization fails due to out of memory, please remove `calibration_providers` in config file.

> ⚠️ If optimization fails during context binary generation, rerun the command. The process will resume from the last completed step.

### **Inference**

The optimized model can be used for inference using ONNX Runtime QNNExecutionProvider and ONNX Runtime GenAI. **Inference must be run on a Windows Copilot+ PC with a Qualcomm NPU.**

#### **Install Required Packages (arm64 Python)**
```bash
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/refs/heads/main/requirements.txt
pip install -U --pre --extra-index-url https://aiinfra.pkgs.visualstudio.com/PublicPackages/_packaging/ORT-Nightly/pypi/simple onnxruntime-qnn --no-deps
pip install "onnxruntime-genai>=0.7.0rc2"
```
